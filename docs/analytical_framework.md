\# Analytical framework and assumptions



\## Purpose of the analysis



This analysis examines district-level patterns in health service functionality and suspected cholera in Yemen between January 2019 and May 2021. The aim is to identify areas of persistently low service availability, sustained cholera pressure, and deteriorating reporting coverage. The analysis is intended to generate cautious decision signals for humanitarian health actors, rather than definitive conclusions or burden estimates.



\## Unit of analysis



The primary unit of analysis is the district–month. Each observation represents one district reporting for one calendar month. Governorate-level summaries are used only as a secondary analytical layer and only where reporting coverage is sufficient. National-level trends are not treated as analytically meaningful given uneven reporting over time.



\## Time window



The dataset covers January 2019 to May 2021. Given declining reporting coverage in late 2020 and 2021, the period 2019–2020 is treated as the primary analytical window for trend interpretation. Data from 2021 are used mainly for coverage diagnostics and early warning signals and are interpreted with additional caution.



\## Working definitions of key variables



Percent functioning health centers is treated as a reported proxy for service availability rather than a direct measure of access or quality.



Suspected cholera cases and deaths are treated as surveillance signals and not as confirmed incidence or mortality counts.



The variable labelled percent\_attack\_rate contains values that exceed plausible percentage ranges, suggesting unclear denominators. It is therefore treated as an attack rate as reported and is used only for relative comparison and outlier identification.



Variables related to facility counts and staffing are excluded from core analysis due to high levels of missing data and are used only to illustrate data availability constraints.



Percent of individuals reporting problems accessing health facilities is treated as a perception-based indicator and interpreted cautiously.



\## Analytical constraints and non-claims



This analysis does not infer causality, estimate disease burden, attribute observed patterns to conflict or funding changes, or confirm disease outbreaks. Findings are presented as signals under uncertainty and are contingent on reporting coverage and data quality.



\## Ethical and operational considerations



The data are aggregated and non-identifiable. The analysis avoids stigmatizing language, flags areas with poor reporting as low-confidence rather than low-priority, and highlights data gaps alongside substantive findings.
